# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior
- Use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal/political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., physical/email address) without explicit permission
- Submitting malicious code or intentionally causing problems
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
